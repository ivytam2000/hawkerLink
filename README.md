HawkerLink

HawkerLink is a linkup service for tech-illiterate hawkers in Singapore to connect to tech-savvy volunteers who are able to help them get on food-delivery platforms. Volunteers can match to hawkers in our database by specifying their location and languages they speak. They can also book training sessions on the website as part of their volunteer process.
